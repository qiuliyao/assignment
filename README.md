# one_dimensional_heat_diffusion_equation

  for one dimension heat diffusion equation, we use the FTCS differential format, which is the Euler forward in time central in space, to get a numerical solution. And we compare it with the exact solution. They are similar and they become stable after the 40 seconds.
